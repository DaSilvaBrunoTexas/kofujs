# Kofujs
KofuJS a slightly opinionated and elegant JS framework

## Frontend Framework using

  - Virtual Dom with Snabbdom
  - Coffescript to force a Syntax
  - JSX
  - CSS-in-JS
  - Lodash
  - RXJS ( The whole point is out of box Observables from the ground up)
  - Perhaps Redux

## Starter Kit Contains
	- Kofu
	- Vanilla Router
	- Webpack
	- BrowserSync
	- Babel
	- Gulp
	- Gulp-Coffee
	- Gulp-Nodemon
	- Express (need to set it up where you can add routers on the backend via middleware that is automatically added)


Goal is to be able to make it so it works like NUXT or NEXT out of the box with the Starter Kit but it could also be used as a mere SPA with using just Kofu.js and Vanilla Router
  todo : fork Vanilla Router and make Kofu Router

## Project Reason
    - Academic pursuit as a faculty member
    - Main purpose is to show students inner workings of FrontEnd / Full Satck Frameworks
    - Secondary Purpose is for usage with Freelance Projects
    - Third purpose is that maybe someone will love the project and use it for their own projects and hopefully help make it better
## Timeline to Beta
    - Hopeful Beta is May 22 2020
## todo
    - Create a build chain and dev server setup with Gulp, Webpack, Express, Nodemon and BrowserSync
    - Integrate JSS
    - Integrate Lodash Natively by exposing map, reduce and filter to every component
    - Set up RXJS
