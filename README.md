# Kofujs
KofuJS a slightly opinionated and elegant JS framework

## Frontend Framework using

  - Virtual Dom with Snabbdom
  - Coffescript 
  - JSX
  - CSS-in-JS
  - Lodash

## Starter Kit Contains
	- Kofu
	- Vanilla Router
	- Webpack
	- BrowserSync
	- Babel
	- Gulp
	- Gulp-Coffee
	- Gulp-Nodemon
	- Express (need to set it up where you can add routers on the backend via middleware that is automatically added)
	

Goal is to be able to make it so it works like NUXT or NEXT out of the box with the Starter Kit but it could also be used as a mere SPA with using just Kofu.js and Vanilla Router 
  todo : fork Vanilla Router and make Kofu Router

    - Secondary Purpose is for usage with Freelance Projects
